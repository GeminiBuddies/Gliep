# TODO list

## X-lang

### About table

- Glug language needs lists. An acceptable approach is to make tables here more lua-like, which means
  - Integer index optimization. (Glos)
  - Extended table literal syntax. (Glug)

## Glos

### GlosUnit

- Serialization and deserialization of GlosUnit.
- Debug info in GlosUnit.

## Glug

### A set of useful operators

- Locally ren and uen operators.
- ~~Short-circuit operators.~~
- ~~Is-nil and nil-coalescing operators.~~
- Compound-assignment operators.

### Table iteration

- Table iteration is very important. "for" in lua is a very good example.

### Misc

- ~~Add a new ast node type who converts osls to values. (required by Glute)~~
